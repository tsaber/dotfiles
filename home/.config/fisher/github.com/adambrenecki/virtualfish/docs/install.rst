Installation and Setup
======================

Installing
----------

1. Make sure you're running Fish 2.x. If you're running an Ubuntu LTS
   release that has an older Fish version, `install Fish 2.x via the
   fish-shell/release-2
   PPA <https://launchpad.net/~fish-shell/+archive/release-2>`__.
2. Install virtualfish by running ``pip install virtualfish``.
3. Add the following to your
   ``~/.config/fish/config.fish``:

   ::

       eval (python -m virtualfish)

   If you want to use virtualfish with :doc:`plugins <plugins>`, list
   the names of the plugins as arguments to the virtualfish loader:

   ::

       eval (python -m virtualfish compat_aliases)

   *Note:* If your ``config.fish`` modifies your ``$PATH``, you should
   ensure that you load virtualfish *after* those modifications.

4. Customize your ``fish_prompt``

Customizing Your ``fish_prompt``
--------------------------------

virtualfish doesn't attempt to mess with your prompt. Since Fish's
prompt is a function, it is both much less straightforward to change it
automatically, and much more convenient to simply customize it manually
to your liking.

The easiest way to add virtualenv to your prompt is to type
``funced fish_prompt``, add the following line in somewhere:

::

    if set -q VIRTUAL_ENV
        echo -n -s (set_color -b blue white) "(" (basename "$VIRTUAL_ENV") ")" (set_color normal) " "
    end

Then, type ``funcsave fish_prompt`` to save your new prompt to disk.
