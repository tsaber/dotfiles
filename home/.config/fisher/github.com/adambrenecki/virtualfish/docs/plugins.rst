Plugins
=======

Virtualfish comes in-built with a number of plugins.

You can use them by passing their names in as arguments to the virtualfish
loader in your ``config.fish``, e.g.::

   eval (python -m virtualfish auto_activation global_requirements)

.. _compat_aliases:

Virtualenvwrapper Compatibility Aliases (``compat_aliases``)
------------------------------------------------------------

This plugin provides some global commands to make virtualfish behave more like
Doug Hellman's virtualenvwrapper.

Commands
........


-  ``workon <envname>`` = ``vf activate <envname>``
-  ``deactivate`` = ``vf deactivate``
-  ``mkvirtualenv [<options>] <envname>`` = ``vf new [<options>] <envname>``
-  ``mktmpenv [<options>]`` = ``vf tmp [<options>]``
-  ``rmvirtualenv`` = ``vf rm <envname>``
-  ``lsvirtualenv`` = ``vf ls``
-  ``cdvirtualenv`` = ``vf cd``
-  ``cdsitepackages`` = ``vf cdpackages``
-  ``add2virtualenv`` = ``vf addpath``
-  ``allvirtualenv`` = ``vf all``
-  ``setvirtualenvproject`` = ``vf connect``


.. _auto_activation:

Auto-activation (``auto_activation``)
--------------------------------------

With this plugin enabled,
virtualfish can automatically activate a virtualenv when you are in a
certain directory. To configure it to do so, change to the directory,
activate the desired virtualenv, and run ``vf connect``.

This will save the name of the virtualenv to the file ``.venv``. Virtualfish
will then look for this file every time you ``cd`` into the directory (or
``pushd``, or anything else that modifies ``$PWD``).


.. note::

    When this plugin is enabled, ensure any modifications to your ``$PATH`` in
    your ``config.fish`` happen before virtualfish is loaded.

Commands
........

-  ``vf connect`` - Connect the current virtualenv to the current
   directory, so that it is activated automatically as soon as you
   enter it (and deactivated as soon as you leave).

Configuration Variables
.......................

-  ``VIRTUALFISH_ACTIVATION_FILE`` (default: ``.venv``) - the name of
   the file virtualfish will use for the auto-activation feature. Earlier
   versions of virtualfish used ``.vfenv``.

State Variables
...............

-  ``VF_AUTO_ACTIVATED`` - If the currently-activated virtualenv was
   activated automatically, set to the directory that triggered the
   activation. Otherwise unset.

Global Requirements (``global_requirements``)
---------------------------------------------

Keeps a global ``requirements.txt`` file that is applied to every existing and
new virtualenv.

Commands
........

-  ``vf requirements`` - Edit the global requirements file in your
   ``$EDITOR``. Applies the requirements to all virtualenvs on exit.

Projects (``projects``)
-----------------------

This plugin adds project management capabilities, including automatic directory
switching upon virtual environment activation. Typically a project directory
contains files — such as source code managed by a version control system — that
are often stored separately from the virtual environment.

The following example will create a new project, with a matching virtual
environment, both named ``YourProject``::

    vf project YourProject

The above command performs the following tasks:

1. creates new empty project directory in ``PROJECT_HOME`` (if there is no
   existing ``YourProject`` directory within) and changes the current working
   directory to it
2. creates new virtual environment named ``YourProject`` and activates it

To work on an existing project, use the ``vf workon <name>`` command to activate
the specified virtual environment and change the current working directory to
the project of the same name. For cases in which the project name differs from
the target virtualenv name, you can manually specify which virtualenv should be
activated for a given project by creating a ``.venv`` file inside the project
root containing the name of the corresponding virtualenv.

If you use sub-folders, have projects located outside of ``PROJECT_HOME``, or
utilize a project organization strategy that does not lend itself to storing
all your projects in the root of a single directory, you may navigate to your
project and associate the current working directory with the currently-activated
virtual environment via the following example steps::

   vf activate YourVirtualenv
   cd /path/to/your/project
   echo $PWD > $VIRTUALENV/.project

In the future, you may then run ``vf workon YourVirtualenv`` to simultaneously
activate ``YourVirtualenv`` and switch to the ``/path/to/your/project``
directory.

Commands
........

-  ``vf project <name>`` - Create a new project and matching virtual environment
   with the specified name. This name **must** be the last parameter (i.e.,
   after ``-p python3`` or any other arguments destined for the ``virtualenv``
   command). If ``VIRTUALFISH_COMPAT_ALIASES`` is set, ``mkproject`` is aliased
   to this command.

-  ``vf workon <name>`` - Search for a project and/or virtualenv matching the
   specified name. If found, this activates the appropriate virtualenv and
   switches to the respective project directory. If ``VIRTUALFISH_COMPAT_ALIASES``
   is set, ``workon`` is aliased to this command.

-  ``vf lsprojects`` - List projects available in ``$PROJECT_HOME`` (see below)

-  ``vf cdproject`` - Search for a project matching the name of the currently
   activated virtualenv. If found, this switches to the respective project
   directory. If ``VIRTUALFISH_COMPAT_ALIASES`` is set, ``cdproject`` is aliased
   to this command.

Configuration Variables
.......................

-  ``PROJECT_HOME`` (default: ``~/projects/``) - Where to create new projects
   and where to look for existing projects.

Environment Variables (``environment``)
---------------------------------------

This plugin provides the ability to automatically set environment variables
when a virtual environment is activated. The environment variables are stored
in a ``.env`` file by default. This can be configured by setting
``VIRTUALFISH_ENVIRONMENT_FILE`` to the desired file name. When using the
`Projects (projects)`_ plugin, the env file is stored in the project
directory unless it is manually created in the ``$VIRTUAL_ENV`` directory. If
the projects plugin isn't being used, the file is stored in the ``$VIRTUAL_ENV``
directory.

When the virtualenv is activated, the values in the env file will be added to
the environment. If a variable with that name already exists, that value is
stored in ``__VF_ENVIRONMENT_OLD_VALUE_$key``.

When the virtual environment is deactivated, if there was a pre-existing value
it is returned to the environment. Otherwise, the variable is erased.

The format of the env file is one key-value set per line separated by an ``=``.
Empty lines are ignored, as are any lines that start with ``#``. See the
following::

    # This is a valid comment and declaration
    FOO=bar

    # The empty line above is valid
    BAR=baz  # A following comment like this is NOT okay

Commands
........

- ``vf environment`` - Open the env file for the active virtual environment in
  ``$VISUAL``/``$EDITOR`` or ``vi`` if neither variable is set.

Update Python (``update_python``)
-----------------------

This plugin adds commands to change the python interpreter of the current
virtual environment.

Commands
........

-  ``vf update_python [<python_exe>]`` - Remove the current virtual environment
   and create a new one with ``<python_exe>`` (defaults to
   ``VIRTUALFISH_DEFAULT_PYTHON`` if it is set, or the first executable named
   ``python`` in your ``PATH``), and then reinstall all packages in the same
   versions with pip.

-  ``vf fix_python [<python_exe>]`` - Test the current python executable on the
   current virtual environment. If it doesn't work, update it with ``vf
   update_python [<python_exe>]``. This may be usefull when one of your system's
   python executable is updated, and some of your virtual environments are
   broken: you probably just need to run ``vf all vf fix_python``.

Configuration Variables
.......................

-  ``VIRTUALFISH_DEFAULT_PYTHON`` (default: ``python``) - The python interpreter
   to use if not specified on the command line.
