Fishtape is a <a href=https://testanything.org title="Test Anything Protocol">TAP</a>-based test runner for the [fish shell](https://fishshell.com).

Your tests run concurrently in their own sub-shells, siloing your test environment. That means you are free to set variables, define functions, and modify the executing environment without hijacking your current session or other tests.

There's no learning curve. If you know how to use the [`test`](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#test) builtin, you are ready to use Fishtape.

## Installation

With [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) (recommended):

```fish
fisher add jorgebucaran/fishtape
```

<details>
<summary>Not using a package manager?</summary>

---

Copy [`fishtape.fish`](fishtape.fish) to any directory on your function path.

```fish
set -q XDG_CONFIG_HOME; or set XDG_CONFIG_HOME ~/.config
curl https://git.io/fishtape.fish --create-dirs -sLo $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fish/functions/fishtape.fish
```

To uninstall, remove the file.

### System Requirements

- [fish](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) 2.0+

## Usage

A test file is a regular `fish` file with `@test` declarations. A test declaration (or test case) consists of a description, followed by one or more operators and their arguments. You can use any operator supported by the [`test`](https://fishshell.com/docs/current/commands.html#test) builtin except for the `-a` and `-o` conditional operators.

```fish
@test "math is real" (math 41 + 1) -eq 42

@test "basename is fish" (
    string split -rm1 / /usr/local/bin/fish
)[-1] = "fish"

@test "test is a builtin" (
    contains -- test (builtin -n)
) $status -eq 0

@test "print a sequence of numbers" (seq 3) = "1 2 3"
```

Run `fishtape` with one or more test files to run your tests.

```sh
fishtape tests/*.fish
```

```diff
TAP version 13
ok 1 math is real
ok 2 basename is fish
ok 3 test is a builtin
ok 4 print a sequence of numbers

1..4
# pass 4
# ok
```

Test files run in the background in a subshell while individual test cases run sequentially. The output is buffered (delivered in batches) until all jobs are complete. If all the tests pass, `fishtape` exits with status `0`â€”else, it exits with status `1`.

A buffered output means we can't write to stdout or stderr without running into race conditions. To print a TAP message along with a batch of test results, use the `@mesg` declaration.

```fish
@mesg "Brought to you by the friendly interactive shell."
```

### Setup and Teardown

You can define special `setup` and `teardown` functions, which run before and after each test case, respectively. Use them to load fixtures, set up your environment, and clean up when you're done.

```fish
function setup
    set -g tmp (command mktemp -d /tmp/foo.XXXXX)
    command mkdir -p $tmp
end

function teardown
    command rm -rf $tmp
end

@test "directory is empty" -z (
    pushd $tmp
    command ls -1
    popd
)
```

### Special Variables

The following variables are globally available for all test files:

- `$current_dirname` is the directory where the currently running test file is located.
- `$current_filename` is the name and extension of the currently running test file.

## Reporting Options

TAP is a text-based protocol for reporting test results. It's easy to parse for machines and still readable for humans. But it isn't the end of it. If you are looking for reporting alternatives, see [this list of reporters](https://github.com/substack/tape#pretty-reporters) or try [tap-mocha-reporter](https://github.com/tapjs/tap-mocha-reporter) for an all-in-one solution.

Once you've downloaded a TAP-compliant reporter and put it somewhere in your `$PATH`, pipe `fishtape` to it.

> Redirections and pipes involving blocks are run serially in fish (see [fish-shell/#1396](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/1396)). This means we must run `fishtape` in a subshell to enable streaming support.

```fish
fish -c "fishtape test/*.fish" | tap-nyan
```
